    Technology has the power to transform our lives. It has opened up new opportunities, connecting us to people from
    around the world and giving us access to knowledge and resources we never thought possible before. My journey in
    tech began with a curiosity that led me down the path of learning more about Information Security, Computer Science
    and Web Development. Along my way, I'm also sharing my experience and knowledge here as I go along. Join me as I
    explore the ever-changing world of technology, one line of code at a time!
